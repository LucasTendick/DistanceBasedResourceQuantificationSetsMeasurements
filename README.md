Implementation of the SDPs presented in 'Distance-based resource quantification for sets of quantum measurements' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08546.pdf) by
L. Tendick, M. Kliesch, H. Kampermann and, D. Bru√ü. If you use any of the codes for academic research, please cite this paper. If you have any questions about the codes,
comments, etc., feel free to contact me: lucas.tendcik@hhu.de. 

The codes make use of functions from the QETLAB package (https://qetlab.com/, https://github.com/nathanieljohnston/QETLAB) and functions from the
steerinreview package (https://github.com/paulskrzypczyk/steeringreview, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6633/80/2/024001) which are also included here, 
with their respective README and license files. 


The codes were tested on Matlab 2016b (win64) together with CVX 2.2 (http://cvxr.com/).
