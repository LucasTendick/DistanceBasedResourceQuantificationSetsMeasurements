function [Dist] = AssemblageDiamondDistance(Max,Nax,p)

% This function is based on the the work 'Distance-based resource
% quantification for sets of quantum measurements' (see: arXiv:2205.08546)

% The function AssemblageDiamondDistance computes
% the diamond distance according to Eq. (11) 

% Inputs: 
% 1) a 4-D array, containing the POVM elements of the assemblage M. The first two
% dimensions contain the POVM elements (the Matrix representation),
% while the remaining two dimensions are (a,x), such that Max(:,:,a,x) = M_a|x.
% The outcome 'a' is the 3rd and the setting 'x' the 4th dimension.

% 2) a 4-D array, containing the POVM elements of the assemblage N. The first two
% dimensions contain the POVM elements (the Matrix representation),
% while the remaining two dimensions are (a,x), such that Nax(:,:,a,x) = N_a|x.
% The outcome 'a' is the 3rd and the setting 'x' the 4th dimension.


% 3) a probability vector denoting the probabilities for choosing the
% settings x with probabbility p(x). For example p = ones(1,m)/m is
% a uniform distribution for m settings

%Outputs
% 1) Dist, the distance between the assemblages M and N



% Requires: CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/), A solver like SDPT3, Sedumi or
% Mosek, etc.
