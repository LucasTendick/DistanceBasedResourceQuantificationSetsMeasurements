function [Incomp,Fax] = IncompatibilityDiamondNorm(Max,p)

% This function is based on the the work 'Distance-based resource
% quantification for sets of quantum measurements' (see: arXiv:2205.08546)

% The function IncompatibilityDiamondNorm quantifies the 
% incompatibility according to Eq. (21) respectively SDP Eq. (69) (or Eq.
% (E1).

% Inputs: 
% 1) a 4-D array, containing the POVM elements. The first two
% dimensions contain the POVM elements (the Matrix representation),
% while the remaining two dimensions are (a,x), such that Max(:,:,a,x) = M_a|x.
% The outcome 'a' is the 3rd and the setting 'x' the 4th dimension.

% 2) a probability vector denoting the probabilities for choosing the
% settings x with probabbility p(x). For example p = ones(1,m)/m is
% a uniform distribution for m settings

%Outputs:
% 1) Incomp, the value of the incompatibility of M_a|x
% 2) Fax, the closest jointly measureable assemblage F_a|x


% Requires: CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/), A solver like SDPT3, Sedumi or
% Mosek, etc., QETLAB (http://www.qetlab.com) for the functions (PermuteSystems, DiamondNorm)
